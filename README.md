This project was a deep dive into the HTML5 canvas element. By following a tutorial from Wes Bos' JavaScript30, I explored the capabilities of JavaScript to manipulate pixels on a canvas. I implemented interactive drawing features using mouse events, dynamically adjusting line width and color. This project solidified my understanding of canvas fundamentals and event handling, laying the groundwork for more complex canvas-based applications.
